  When validation passes on dev, open a PR from dev into the next branch that
  updates the changelog, README, and CLAUDE.md files. Gated: it does not auto-merge unless the
  PR is approved.

    # MERGE THIS WITH A MERGE COMMIT — NEVER SQUASH. Squashing dev into next rewrites the
    # SHAs, so next stops descending from dev and main stops descending from next. That is
    # what forced the old cherry-pick promotion model and every heuristic under it. To
    # automate, add `auto-merge: true` only once the repo's default merge method for this

# Dev → Next

The `Validation` workflow finished on `dev`. Promote only when the integration branch is green.

## Guard

1. If the triggering run's conclusion is not `success`, call `noop` and stop.
2. If there are no changes on `dev` ahead of the release branch, call `noop` and stop.

## Prepare the release PR

Open a PR from `dev` into `next`. On the PR branch, update the following so the promotion is
self-describing:

1. **CHANGELOG** — add/update an entry summarizing the features and fixes merged into `dev` since
   the last release (group by feature; reference the issues/PRs). Create `CHANGELOG.md` if absent.
   Use a top-level `## [Unreleased]` heading for the in-progress entry. `release-tag.yml` will
   rename that heading to `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` when the promotion PR merges into `main`, so
   the anchor MUST be exactly `## [Unreleased]` (case and brackets) for the stamp to find it. Write
   commit bullets using conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) for
   readability — note that the version bump itself is derived from lines changed, not prefixes.
2. **README.md** — update only what the new features actually changed (setup steps, feature list,
   screenshots references, version). Do not rewrite unrelated sections.
3. **CLAUDE.md files** — update the root `CLAUDE.md` and any package/app `CLAUDE.md` so agent
   guidance reflects new modules, commands, or conventions introduced this cycle. Skip files that
   need no change.

Keep edits scoped to documentation; do not touch source in this PR.

## Output

- Open the release PR with a description that lists what's included, links the closed issues, and
  states the validation status (validation passed on `dev`).
- The PR is created **ready for review but not auto-merged**. A maintainer approves; the merge
  to `next` **must be a merge commit, not a squash** — squashing severs the ancestry the release
  model depends on (see `.github/BRANCH-AND-RELEASE-POLICY.md`). Merge is then performed via the
  repo's merge settings (or auto-merge if you enabled the
  toggle above).

If there is nothing to release or document, call `noop`.
